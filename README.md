#### Problem hypothesis

Running out of seed products you use daily disrupts your tranquility

#### Design experiments

- You can buy at lower prices perishable food or seeds from a supplier
- You want to buy a lot of the same thing at once because you know you are going to use it
- You can pick up your share of the loot from the person who initiates the buying group
- You have storage space to hold up 10kg of sesame <insert any other type of thing>

###### Riskiest Assumption

- You want to buy a lot of the same thing at once because you know you are going to use it
